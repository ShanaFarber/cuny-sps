The goal of this assignment was to use data visuals to answer the question "do stricted gun laws help reduce firearm mortality?" 

Data for firearm mortality rates gathered from the CDC using [Socrata Open Data API](https://dev.socrata.com/). Gun law ratings taking from [Gifford's Gun Law Scorecard](https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard2020/). 

`data_wrangling.py` contains the code to download the CDC data and save it as a csv file for easy loading later on.
