# Assignment 2

`movie_ratings.sql` creates the tables in PostgreSQL. The csv files are included in the GitHub repo. 

I am working on Windows operating system and I moved the csv files to Temp folder so the Postgres server would be able to access them.

`Assignment2.Rmd` loads the schemas into R directly from the PostgreSQL server.
