### Abstract

This study investigates factors associated with motor vehicle collisions and their relationships with collision severity. The analysis was conducted using car crash data obtained from the New York City Police Department, which contains approximately 2 million collision records. The highest number of recorded collisions occurred between 2016-2018, with approximately 225,000 collisions occurring in each of these years. While the overall number of collisions seems to decrease from 2018-2022, the number of fatality or injury-inducing collisions increased by approximately 18% from 2018 to 2022.

Brooklyn had the highest number of collisions across all years, accounting for about 31-35% of collisions annually. Driver inattention or distraction was found to be the primary contributing factor for collisions, with approximately 31% of recorded reasons attributed to a driver not paying attention or being distracted. Alcohol abuse was identified as the main contributing factor for car crashes between the hours of 2-4 AM. Moreover, there is a significant relationship between alcohol/drug involvement in collisions and collisions severity.

The median age of drivers, irrespective of gender, was found to be 40, with approximately 50% of drivers falling between the ages of 29-53. The highest number of collisions were caused by drivers in the age range of 25-40. The data set recorded more than twice the number of collisions caused by men than by women. The median age of men involved in collisions was found to be 40, whereas the median age of women involved in collisions was 38. A significant relationship was observed between gender and age with respect to collisions, with the average age of males involved in collisions being higher than the average age of females involved in collisions.
